# Resting B Face App

## Team members 
### Zarrina Niyazova, Natasha Umer, Richard Boles

## Description:
    This app will view an image and render results based off the persons facial expression using  Algorithmia Deep Learning API. 

## Why we created the app:
    Resting mean face is a serious problem and syndrome many people face (no pun intended). We feel they need to know what level their mean face is at. We highly recommend that you and your love ones try out this app to see where you score.

## UX/UI / User Stories:    
    The landing page will display the title of the app at the top and a place to insert the  image. They can chose to upload a file or enter a url. Also, on the landing page is a link to the about page that will explain everything about the app. After submitting an image the computer will show the results of happiness, sadness, surprise, anger, fear, contempt, disgust and neutral. After the image is shown there will also be questions that pop up to ask the user if they are mad or angry. After viewing the results the user can pick a different image to get results for.
