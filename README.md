# Resting B Face App

## Team members 
### Zarrina Niyazova, Natasha Umer, Richard Boles

## Description:
    Curious to know if you suffer from RBF aka "Resting B***ch Face Syndrome?" Our app will analyze photos of faces, using  machine-learning/ A.I. and our own alogrithim, to determine if the person in the photo has "RBF." 
    

## UX/UI / User Stories    
    The landing page will display the title of the app at the top and a place to insert the  image. The users enter a url in the input box to upload an image. Also, on the landing page is a link to the about page that will explain everything about the app. After submitting an image, our app will tell the user if the person in the picture has RBF and give them a score between 1-10.  After the image is shown there will also be questions that pop up to ask the user if they are mad or angry, and they can save the results in our database. After viewing the results the user can pick a different image to get results for.
